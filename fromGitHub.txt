This is an awesome file I added directly from Github.com
And now I am about to commit directly to Gothub.com remote repository
This is not something we eould do normally
We are just trying simulate a situation where remote remote repository history is ahead of local reposit=ory history
in plain english remote has one additional commit that local does not have
